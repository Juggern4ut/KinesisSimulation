        <h2>What is kinesis?</h2>
        <p>
          Many insects and microorganisms do not have the luxury of having a
          sensory system that informs them of a incoming thread. Instead they
          have to resort to a method called 'kinesis' which, for example, is
          found in wood lice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Simply put, an organism using kinesis will slow down and move less
          when everything is in order and slightly speed up if any problems
          arise.

        <h2>What do we see here?</h2>
        <p>
          This is my attempt to simulate lots of organisms that move based only
          on the simple rules given by kinesis.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the middle of the given area, 2000 organisms will be placed. They
          will move randomly around the given space. All they can sense is their
          own satisfaction which will slowly increase on the right side of the
          field and decrease on the left side.
        </p>

        <p>
          Based on the concept of kinesis, after only a short while, there
          should be a major amount of all organisms on the good side.
